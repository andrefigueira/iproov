# iProove test

Started @ 17:40
Finished @ 18:17

1. Read about WebCodecs
2. Created the project, and asked Claude to take me into a deep dive into Codecs and how it works, decided to do a very basic frameworkless/libraryless implementation
3. Wrote out the basic structure for the application using typescript and also used pseudocomments, also commented everything as I would build it as placeholders until I added code
4. Finished writing out my initial implementation then validated my approach with Claude, Also used claude to write unit tests for me and to add in linting and a few other goodies.
5. Testing and adjustments until I got it working.
6. Bonus, once I got it working, I added an extra step and used openAI for basic validation of the image to confirm the user is facing the camera, and also if they are wearing headwear or glasses.
7. Went through and validated and tried to spot potential issues
